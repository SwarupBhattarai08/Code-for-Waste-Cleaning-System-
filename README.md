   Hand excavation was the first method of sewage cleaning, in which workers placed sediment into barrows that were transported
   down the sewer and then lifted out by bucket at manholes. The main difficulty with manual scavenging is the employees' health.
   Despite the fact that automation is increasingly vital in all industrial applications, efficient sewage disposal from industries 
   and commercials remains a difficult task. To address the real-time issues, a drainage cleaning system is proposed. The goal of this
   project is to replace manual effort in drainage cleaning by providing a semi-automated system that controls waste disposal and filters
   waste on a regular basis. In our model, a pneumatic piston is linked to a wire rope, which is then connected to kinematic linkages.
   The frame's linkage is to be immersed in the sewage. When the pneumatic piston is actuated, the bottom grippers expand and gather the
   solid wastes from the sewage. Finally, our goal is to create a machine that is both cost effective and efficient in operation.
